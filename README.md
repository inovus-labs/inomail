Creating a README for a Node.js project to send out personalized unique emails with multiple unique and/or common file attachments can help you document your project and make it more accessible to collaborators and users. Here's a template you can use as a starting point for your project's README:

# Project Name

## Description

This Node.js project allows you to send out personalized, unique emails with multiple unique and/or common file attachments. It's a versatile tool for automating email communications, suitable for various use cases such as newsletters, marketing campaigns, or personalized notifications.

## Features

- Personalized emails: Customize the content of each email based on recipient data.
- Multiple attachments: Attach one or more files to each email.
- Common attachments: Include common attachments in all emails.
- Email scheduling: Send emails immediately or schedule them for a later time.
- Logging: Track the status of sent emails and any errors that occur.
- Easy configuration: Configure the email templates, recipients, and attachments through a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the project by editing the `config.js` file. Make sure to provide your SMTP server details, email templates, and other necessary configuration.

## Usage

1. Populate the recipient data: Prepare a CSV or JSON file containing recipient information, such as names, email addresses, and any custom fields required for email customization.

2. Add attachments: Place the common attachments in a designated folder. For unique attachments, specify the file paths in your recipient data (e.g., a column in your CSV).

3. Customize email templates: Create email templates in the project's designated template folder. Use placeholders to include recipient-specific information.

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the recipient data file, specify email scheduling, and monitor the progress of email sending.
