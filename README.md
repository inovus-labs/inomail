## Features

- **Personalized emails** : Customize the content of each email based on recipient data.
- **Attachments** : Attach both common and recipient-specific files to your emails.
- **Handlebar templates** : Create and manage email templates with Handlebars.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inovus-labs/inomail.git
   cd inomail
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER = <your_email_address>
   EMAIL_PASS = <your_email_app_password>
   PORT = 5000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Populate the recipient data:** Prepare a CSV or XLSX file containing recipient information, such as `full_name` , `email_address` and any custom fields required for email customization.

   > The first row of the file should contain the column names. The column names will be used as placeholders in the email templates.
   
   > For example, if you have a column named `full_name` , you can use the placeholder `{full_name}` in your email templates to include the recipient's full name in the email content.

   > Save the file in the project's `public` folder as `email_list.xlsx` .

2. **Add attachments:** For both unique and common attachments, specify the file names in your recipient data (e.g., a column in your XLSX file). Place the files in the project's designated attachments folder.

   > Column names should match the subfolder names in the attachments folder (e.g., if you have a column named `asset_1` , the corresponding file should be placed in the `asset_1` subfolder).
   
   > Common assets are treated as unique assets for each recipient. If you want to include the same file in all emails, add a column named `common_asset` to your recipient data and place the file in the `common_asset` subfolder.

3. **Customize email templates:** Create HTML email templates in the project's `public` folder. Use placeholders to include recipient-specific information. Save the template as `email_content.hbs`.

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The terminal start prompting the results of the email sending process.
